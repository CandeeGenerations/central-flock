# Nursery Schedule Generator — Implementation Plan

## Context

The church currently creates nursery worker schedules manually in a document editor, assigning workers to four services across Sundays and Wednesdays each month. This feature automates schedule generation with configurable workers, service requirements, and constraints — then exports the result as PDF/JPG matching the existing format. It becomes a new top-level section in Central Flock alongside Messaging and Devotions.

## Database: Separate `nursery.db`

Following the Devotions pattern (`server/db-devotions/`), nursery gets its own SQLite database.

### New files

- `server/db-nursery/schema.ts` — Drizzle schema (6 tables below)
- `server/db-nursery/index.ts` — Connection setup (WAL mode, foreign keys, export `nurseryDb`)
- `drizzle-nursery.config.ts` — Drizzle Kit config pointing to `nursery.db`

### Schema

**`nursery_workers`** — People who can work nursery
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | integer PK auto | |
| name | text NOT NULL | |
| maxPerMonth | integer NOT NULL default 4 | Overall monthly cap |
| allowMultiplePerDay | boolean NOT NULL default false | Can work >1 service same day |
| isActive | boolean NOT NULL default true | |
| createdAt, updatedAt | text (datetime) | |

**`nursery_worker_services`** — Which services each worker is eligible for
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | integer PK auto | |
| workerId | integer FK → nursery*workers (cascade) | |
| serviceType | text enum | `sunday_school`, `morning`, `evening`, `wednesday_evening` |
| maxPerMonth | integer nullable | Per-service cap; null = no per-service limit |

**`nursery_service_config`** — How many workers each service needs
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| serviceType | text PK | `sunday_school`, `morning`, `evening`, `wednesday_evening` |
| label | text NOT NULL | Display name (e.g., "Sunday School Service") |
| workerCount | integer NOT NULL default 2 | 1 or 2 |
| sortOrder | integer NOT NULL | Display order |

Seeded at startup via INSERT OR IGNORE in `db-nursery/index.ts` with defaults from the PDF:

- Sunday School Service → 1 worker, sort 1
- Morning Service → 2 workers, sort 2
- Evening Service → 1 worker, sort 3
- Wednesday Evening Service → 2 workers, sort 4

**`nursery_schedules`** — Generated schedules (historical record)
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | integer PK auto | |
| month | integer NOT NULL | 1-12 |
| year | integer NOT NULL | |
| status | text enum `draft` / `final` | draft = editable, final = locked |
| createdAt, updatedAt | text (datetime) | |

**`nursery_assignments`** — Individual worker slot assignments
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | integer PK auto | |
| scheduleId | integer FK → nursery*schedules (cascade) | |
| date | text NOT NULL | YYYY-MM-DD (actual date, may cross month boundary) |
| serviceType | text enum | |
| slot | integer NOT NULL | 1 or 2 |
| workerId | integer FK → nursery_workers (set null on delete) | nullable for unassigned slots |
| \_unique* | (scheduleId, date, serviceType, slot) | |

**`nursery_settings`** — Key-value store for logo path, etc.
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| key | text PK | |
| value | text NOT NULL | |
| updatedAt | text (datetime) | |

## Seed Data (from April PDF)

Seeded at startup via INSERT OR IGNORE alongside the service config.

## Generation Algorithm

File: `server/services/nursery-scheduler.ts`

### Date Calculation: `computeDatePairs(month, year) → {sunday: string, wednesday: string}[]`

1. Find all Sundays in the target month
2. If >= 5 Sundays, take the first 5
3. If 4 Sundays, prepend the last Sunday of the previous month
4. For each Sunday, the paired Wednesday = Sunday + 3 days
5. Return 5 pairs with dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings

### Slot Generation: `buildSlots(pairs, serviceConfig) → ScheduleSlot[]`

For each pair, expand into ordered slots:

- Sunday services (sunday_school, morning, evening) in sort order — each creates 1 or 2 slots based on `workerCount`
- Wednesday service (wednesday_evening) — same logic
- Only create slot 2 if `workerCount === 2`

### Assignment: `assignWorkers(slots, workers) → ScheduleSlot[]`

Sorted greedy approach:

1. Maintain counters: `totalAssignments[workerId]`, `serviceAssignments[workerId][serviceType]`, `dayAssignments[workerId][date]`
2. For each slot, collect eligible workers where:
   - `isActive === true`
   - Has a `nursery_worker_services` row for this `serviceType`
   - `totalAssignments < worker.maxPerMonth`
   - If `worker_services.maxPerMonth` is set: `serviceAssignments < that limit`
   - If `!allowMultiplePerDay`: `dayAssignments[date] === 0`
3. Sort eligible workers by fewest total assignments (distribute evenly)
4. Pick first candidate; if none eligible, leave slot `workerId: null` (flagged in UI)

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/nav-config.ts` | Add "Nursery" nav group with `Baby` icon (lucide-react)              |
| `src/App.tsx`           | Add 5 nursery routes                                                 |

| `package.json`          | Add `db:nursery:*` scripts, add `html2canvas` + `jspdf` dependencies |

### Navigation (nav-config.ts)

```
Nursery (Baby icon)
  ├── Schedules → /nursery (end: true)
  ├── Workers → /nursery/workers
  └── Settings → /nursery/settings
```

### Key Page: Generate Page (`/nursery/generate`)

Single-page workflow with local state:

1. **Select month/year** — month picker, defaults to next month
2. **Click "Generate"** — calls `POST /api/nursery/schedules/generate`, receives full schedule
3. **Preview** — renders `NurserySchedulePreview` with the assignment data
4. **Edit** — click any worker cell → `SearchableSelect` popover to swap workers. Calls `PATCH /api/nursery/assignments/:id` per edit.
5. **Export** — PDF or JPG buttons. Captures the preview component via `html2canvas`.
6. **Finalize** — sets status to `final`, locks edits

### `NurserySchedulePreview` Component

Renders the schedule matching the PDF format exactly:

- Logo image centered at top (from nursery settings)
- HTML table: Date | Service | Worker #1 | Worker #2
- Date cell uses `rowSpan` to span the service rows for that day (3 for Sundays, 1 for Wednesdays)
- Worker #2 shows "-" when service only has 1 worker
- Unassigned slots highlighted with a warning color
- `editMode` prop: when true, worker cells are clickable with searchable dropdown
- Fixed white background + inline styles for reliable html2canvas capture

---

## Export: Client-Side `html2canvas` + `jsPDF`

New dependencies: `html2canvas`, `jspdf`

### Approach

1. Render `NurserySchedulePreview` in a ref'd container with print-optimized styles
2. `await document.fonts.ready` (ensure webfonts loaded)
3. `html2canvas(container, {scale: 2, useCORS: true})` → canvas
4. **JPG**: `canvas.toBlob('image/jpeg')` → download as `Nursery Schedule - April 2026.jpg`
5. **PDF**: Create jsPDF doc, add canvas image fitted to page → save as `Nursery Schedule - April 2026.pdf`

---

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Database foundation

1. Create `server/db-nursery/schema.ts` with all 6 tables
2. Create `server/db-nursery/index.ts` (connection + seed service config defaults + seed 9 workers from PDF with their service eligibilities)
3. Create `drizzle-nursery.config.ts`
4. Add `db:nursery:generate`, `db:nursery:migrate`, `db:nursery:studio` to `package.json`
5. Run `pnpm db:nursery:migrate`

### Phase 2: Generation algorithm

6. Create `server/services/nursery-scheduler.ts` with `computeDatePairs`, `buildSlots`, `assignWorkers`

### Phase 3: API routes

7. Create `server/routes/nursery.ts` (workers, service config, settings, logo upload)
8. Create `server/routes/nursery-schedules.ts` (schedule CRUD, generate, assignment update)
9. Mount routers in `server/index.ts`, add static serving for logos
10. Add proxy path in `vite.config.ts`

### Phase 4: Frontend API + navigation

11. Create `src/lib/nursery-api.ts` and `src/lib/nursery-query-keys.ts`
12. Add nursery nav group to `src/lib/nav-config.ts`
13. Add routes to `src/App.tsx`

### Phase 5: Pages (in dependency order)

14. `nursery-settings-page.tsx` — service config + logo upload (no deps on other nursery pages)
15. `nursery-worker-form.tsx` + `nursery-workers-page.tsx` — worker management
16. `nursery-schedule-preview.tsx` — the core reusable table component
17. `nursery-schedules-page.tsx` — schedule list (history)
18. `nursery-generate-page.tsx` — the main generate + preview + edit + export flow
19. `nursery-schedule-view-page.tsx` — view/edit saved schedules

### Phase 6: Export

20. Install `html2canvas` + `jspdf`
21. Add export functions to generate page and view page

---

## Verification

1. **Database**: Run `pnpm db:nursery:migrate` → confirm `nursery.db` created with all tables
2. **Workers**: Add 3-4 workers with different service configs → verify CRUD works
3. **Service config**: Change a service from 2 workers to 1 → verify it saves
4. **Logo**: Upload a logo image → verify it displays in preview
5. **Generate**: Generate a schedule for a month with 4 Sundays → confirm 5 pairs with previous month's Sunday borrowed
6. **Generate**: Generate for a month with 5 Sundays → confirm 5 pairs, no borrowing
7. **Constraints**: Verify workers aren't over-assigned (monthly cap, per-service cap, same-day restriction)
8. **Manual edit**: Click a worker cell → swap via dropdown → confirm assignment saved
9. **Unassigned**: Remove all eligible workers for a service → generate → confirm slot shows as unassigned/flagged
10. **Export PDF**: Download → open → verify matches the reference PDF layout
11. **Export JPG**: Download → open → verify image is clean and readable
12. **History**: Generate multiple months → verify schedule list shows all with correct status
13. **Finalize**: Finalize a schedule → confirm edits are blocked
14. **Run `pnpm eslint`** — confirm no type errors or lint violations
